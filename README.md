This is my term project for the course “Introduction to Web Mapping” (CPLN 692) at the University of Pennsylvania. I used data from the National Museum of Natural History to create a web application to visualize the Museum’s volcanoes catalog. Here is a link to the data:

Before creating the app, the data was cleaned and reorganized using R. The app was built from scratch using HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

This app was optimized for Mozilla Firefox Browser.
